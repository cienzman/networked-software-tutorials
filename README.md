# Networked Software for Distributed Systems: A Practical Tutorial
Collection of tutorials for: Akka, Apache Kafka, Node.js  and Node-RED, Apache Spark, MPI, Contiki-NG

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on guide to learning the fundamental abstractions and features of available **networked software platforms**.

It is designed as a tutorial for developers and students interested in **key technologies for the design and implementation of large-scale network applications and complex distributed systems**. This includes diverse scenarios such as:
* High-performance computing (HPC)
* Big-data analytics
* Event-driven architectures
* Internet of Things (IoT)
* Edge computing & The Computing Continum
* Mobile robotics

## Technologies & Domains

This repository covers a wide range of application scenarios, adopting a specific industry-standard software platform for each domain.

| Domain | Technology Framework | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concurrent Systems** | **Akka** | Actor-based model for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications. |
| **Event-driven Apps** | **Apache Kafka** | Distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines. |
| **Computing Continuum** | **Node.js & Node-RED** | Tools for flow-based programming and event-driven servers, bridging edge and cloud. |
| **Big Data Analytics** | **Apache Spark** | Unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. |
| **High-performance Computing** | **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** | Standard for parallel computing on distributed memory systems. |
| **Internet of Things** | **Contiki-NG** | Operating system for low-power, memory-constrained IoT devices. |

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into dedicated folders for each domain. **Each folder acts as a standalone module** containing:
1.  **Source Code:** Practical examples
2.  **Dedicated README:** A step-by-step guide explaining:
    * How to use the specific framework.
    * Prerequisites and installation instructions.
    * How to run the provided examples.
